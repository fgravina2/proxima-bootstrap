# Proxima Bootstrap
A personal grid-system CSS template with minimal footprint, for quick development.

## Why?
Twitter bootstrap is great, but it's very heavy for mobile-first applications. What if every site could be made with less than 10K of template code? Twitter Bootstrap has buttons, ribbons, checkboxes, form input styles... and all I needed was the grid system. So I was able to create a fully function 12-grid mobile-first system in just 4KB (see in "examples/grid-only.html". 
This code was built for personal needs, including all needed code for future projects.

## Resources
* A file with just 4KB, you'll get a 12-grid resizable columns (which can be hidden on desktp and/or mobile)
* Masonry-like gallery, where you can set how many lines should appear, the min. height of each thumbnail and automatic resizing (jQuery is required, working out of the box)
* A modal box template, which you can add your own functionality (Javascript required)
* A tabbing system; tabs inside tabs; tabs under the panel (jQuery is required, working out of the box)
* Menus with submenus, with multiple colors! Just pick your class and let's go!
* Templating system with fixed sidebar and footer always on the bottom of thr screen.
* Small default shading colors of dark and light/lighter/lightest and dark/darker/darkest, for quickly prototype
* An example of modal Login box and a fully login screen;
* A "sandbox" class, which prevents Javascript code to work on 'em;
* ...and a Starry Night (becase I like it hehehe).

## How to test?
Basically open "index.html" and go test all templating examples. Most of 'em aren't usual (like the poll system), but some are (the Masonry-like gallery and the tabs).
Do you find it useful? Feel free to write some entries to this README and expand this code to add more resources, while keeping the footprint low.
