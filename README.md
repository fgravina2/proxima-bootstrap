# Proxima Bootstrap
A personal grid-system CSS template with minimal footprint, for quick development.

## Why?
Twitter bootstrap is amazing, but kinda heavy for mobile-first apps. It has buttons, ribbons, checkboxes, form input styles... and all I needed was the 12-grid system. So I built a fully-working 12-grid mobile-first system in just 4KB (see in "examples/grid-only.html"), and slowly built some layouts and templates around it.
This code was built for personal needs, including all needed code for future projects.

## Resources
* A 12-grid mobile-first CSS file with only 4KB;
* Masonry-like gallery, where you can set how many lines should appear, the min. height of each thumbnail and automatic resize; already working (jQuery required);
* A modal box template;
* A tabbing system, with tabs inside tabs & tabs under the panel (jQuery is required);
* Menus with submenus, with multiple colors! Just pick your class!
* Templating system with fixed sidebar and footer always on the bottom of the screen;
* Small default shading colors of dark and light/lighter/lightest and dark/darker/darkest, for fast prototype;
* An example of modal Login box, a gallery-like page a full login screen.

## How to test?
Index.html contains links for all examples, while internet connection isn't needed (except on the "Tabs" and "Gallery" examples, which uses jQuery). More to be added soon.
